# My Portfolio

Hi, this repository contains files for building my portfolio website. 

Please note that this is a public version. It will not work if you try to clone and run the project. If you want the private version, contact me using my website:

## Tech Stack

I started with AWS Amplify, however, I moved over to Heroku after learning Amplify does not support Node.JS servers. I rely on Node.JS for API needed on my Contact page.

### Front End
React.JS, Material UI (MUI)

### Back End
Node.JS, Gmail API

### Deployment
AWS Amplify/Heroku, Google Domains
